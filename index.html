We are now faced with a deserted world as a result of the unconscious use of water resources of our planet, whose old name is unknown but now called as 'OSIHO22'. It is very difficult to find water in this era. Current waters has some guardians. In very, very old times, there were people who were preparing for these days. Only the water resources that have been kept under control since ancient times have survived. In this world, people began to live in villages by forming colonies. And for the water, each village chose a representative. However, it was quite difficult to get water from the water guards. There was very little water anyway, and they only shared it with the villagers as much as they could meet their needs. Respresentative could only receive a certain amount of water every day. He was opening the valves but could only fill as much as needed. Anyone who tried to take more was immediately punished by the water guards. And it wasn't a simple punishment at all.</p>                       <!-- world content -->

                <p class="mb-5">The Guardians are descendants of these people in ancient times. As the world became desert, the human race evolved by undergoing some mutations. Because it was very difficult to survive and some of us even had to resist the thirst. The Guardians, on the other hand, stayed in the water so much while protecting the water that they no longer looked like a human being but another living thing. Their bodies were covered with shades of green, their hands and feet were veiled to adapt to the waters, and their antennae were protruded to communicate underwater. The water guardians were very powerful and they were the true rulers of the water. With the frequency they extracted from their antennas, they could easily move the water, make waves and use it like a weapon. They are even able to extract the last drop of water from their target. It was not their wish to bully people. In fact, they were very upset about this situation, but they had to act ruthlessly. The continuation of life and the existence of the world were in their hands. Because the human race was so used to consuming, and the world would not even be able to see this day without water protectors.

                <p class="mb-5">A family consisting of a mother, father and 2 children realized that they could no longer meet their water needs in their area. Because the village representative had an argument with the water guardian and was found dead. Therefore, the family moved to leave the village and find another village where they could take shelter. On the way they got caught in a sandstorm. Each one of them have been thrown to the another side. One of the kids covered his face and ran towards a cave. She couldn't see his family. She shouted at them, but she couldn't see anyone coming that way. They were disappeared. She spent days in the cave. She drank the last drop of water in his canteen. She suddenly heard the sound of water in the cave and went deeper into the cave. She saw the glowing purple mushrooms, she was very hungry. She couldn't resist it and ate it all. He hallucinated for days but had a very strong body. She endured, and when she woke up one day, everything had changed. She had turned into another kind of creature. Her head was like a mushroom. Her eyes had fused together, and her body was purple like the mushrooms she had eaten. She was scared, very scared, but she felt strong. She came out of the cave, had grown taller and had a very athletic body. Suddenly she noticed a yellow cloud was following her from behind. She argued with it and told it to go away, but it still followed. An animal appeared in front of her. It rushed towards her, with hungry blue eyes . She needed to protect himself, and so she began to defend himself. She discovered warrior abilities while defending. She suddenly fell to the ground and realized that purple powder was pouring out of her bag. She picked up the dust and threw it towards the cloud with an instinct. She saw the cloud sucked that dust and rain it down on the animal. The powder had neutralized the animal, and it was exhibiting strange movements, as if it was beginning to hallucinate. She realized that Cloud is now her teammate and our character found her potential. He is now a great warrior.
Our character thought that she could fight the water guards, find her family and provide them with water.
Our shroom-headed character doesn't need water anymore, there was no water in her body. She is a warrior now who has a new body, created from shroom dust that is no longer connected to water.
What will the Guardians do now?
Will our warrior be able to bring a new order to this new world?
